The seven paintings he showed there&#8212;which he later destroyed&#8212;were done in a style that combined naturalistic color with Impressionist brushstrokes. At the exhibitors? opening, he met Andr&#233; Derain and Henri Matisse, whose work was considerably more advanced than his. Derain showed three forceful pictures at that Salon, and Matisse exhibited his revolutionary <i>Le Bonheur de vivre</i> (1905&#8211;06, Barnes Foundation, Merion, Pennsylvania). These brightly colored and vigorously painted Fauve works disquieted Braque and gave him much to think about when he returned home to Le Havre later that spring.</p><p>In June 1906 Braque and his fellow Havrais painter Emile-Othon Friesz traveled to Antwerp, one of the most active ports in Europe, where Friesz had worked the previous summer. The city was in some ways like a larger version of Le Havre, so it offered the advantage of providing familiar motifs while being foreign enough to give them the feeling of being abroad. This sense of displacement may well have encouraged them to take greater liberties in their paintings. They stayed on the left bank of the Scheldt River; <i>Landscape near Antwerp</i> is set on the dunes there. On the opposite bank, we can see one of the large commercial buildings and some of the smaller houses along the embankment. Near the center of the painting is the brightly colored spar of a sailboat, and in the distance off to the right are the more elaborate masts of a group of schooners.</p><p>The color scheme reflects Braque?s interest in the chromatic boldness of Fauve painting. If this and related works can be said to have initiated Braque?s Fauve period, it is not only because of their imaginative color, but also because of the emphasis that Braque gave to the patterning of forms on the surface of the canvas. A good deal of the canvas ground is left showing, and there is no evidence of preliminary pencil drawing. Rather, the work was executed following Paul C&#233;zanne?s practice of painting and drawing at the same time. The wedgelike form of the water has the interesting effect of seeming to follow a one-point perspective into deep space while at the same time asserting itself very strongly as a finely designed flat shape. This tension between surface and depth is maintained by the dotted accents of color in the water: they articulate the depth of the area near the mound of earth, but at the same time they strongly restate the surface of the picture. In its finely balanced color harmonies and inventive brushwork, and in the attention that Braque gave to its underlying structure, <i>Landscape near Antwerp</i> anticipates the more fully realized paintings that he would do at L?Estaque the following fall.</p><p>Jack Flam</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

For the next forty years, this estate, which included a large 18th-century house, alleys of chestnut trees, and views of Mont Sainte-Victoire (another of the artist?s favorite sites), afforded C&#233;zanne with many of his subjects. No fewer than thirty-seven oils and sixteen watercolors of the Jas de Bouffan and its immediate environment have been catalogued, but it was only in the mid- and late 1880s that C&#233;zanne explored the varied motifs offered by the manor and its grounds in real depth, as in paintings such as <i>The Neighborhood of Jas de Bouffan</i>. The work has a traditional design, with a large foreground tree at one side and a clump of smaller trees at the other framing a distant view in the center; but in C&#233;zanne?s scrupulous adaptation, it becomes an image of a particular place beyond the walls of his family estate, seen in the warm light of Provence on a cloudless summer day.</p><p>Both the sense of order and the sense of isolation that emanate from this balanced yet uninhabited landscape convey what must have been the artist?s dominant mood in the summer of 1887 or 1888&#8212;calm but resigned, with his frustrated affair of 1885 as well as his loveless marriage, the death of his domineering father, and his break with his boyhood friend Emile Zola in 1886 all now behind him. He summed up this mood of resignation, coupled with a deep immersion in nature, in a letter to the collector Victor Chocquet written in May 1886: ?I should have wished to possess the intellectual equilibrium that characterizes you. . . . Fate has not endowed me with an equal stability, that is the only regret I have about the things of this earth. As for the rest, I have nothing to complain about. Always the sky, the boundless things of nature, attract me and give me the chance to look with pleasure.? And continuing in a vein that seems still more appropriate to <i>The Neighborhood of Jas de Bouffan</i>, he adopted an allegorical style: ?I had a few vineyards, but unexpected frosts came and cut the thread of hope. And my wish would have been, on the contrary, to see them grow well; and so I can only wish you success for your plantations and a good development of your vegetation; green being one of the gayest colors which does the most good to the eyes.? &#185;</p><p>That C&#233;zanne too could achieve such a development, if not in life, at least in art, is evident from <i>The Neighborhood of Jas de Bouffan</i>, in which the vibrant color harmony is dominated by a rich variety of greens, modulating in one sense toward yellow and ocher, in the other toward blue and violet, in a manner at once descriptive and abstract that does indeed do ?the most good to the eyes.?</p><p>T.R.</p><p>1.

Gauguin?s desire to reject Western culture and merge with a naive society for the sake of aesthetic and spiritual inspiration reflects the complex and problematic nature of European ?primitivism.? A concept that emerged at the end of the 19th century, ?primitivism? was motivated by the romantic desire to discover an unsullied paradise hidden within the ?uncivilized? world, as well as by a fascination with what was perceived as the raw, unmediated sensuality of cultural artifacts. This voyeuristic engagement with underdeveloped societies by artists, writers, and philosophers corresponded to French imperialistic practices&#8212;Tahiti, for example, was annexed as a colony in 1881.</p><p>The artist?s idyllic Tahitian landscapes <i>In the Vanilla Grove, Man and Horse</i> and <i>Haere Mai</i> reveal the contradictions between myth and reality that are inherent to ?primitivism.? Both canvases probably depict the area surrounding Mataiea, the small village in which Gauguin settled during the fall of 1891. As richly hued tapestries of flattened forms, they are, however, only evocations of the lush Tahitian terrain, reflecting the simplicity of form sought by the artist during his first visit to the island. Gauguin derived the pose of the man and horse in <i>In the Vanilla Grove</i> not from a scene he found in Tahiti but from a frieze on the quintessential monument of Western culture, the Parthenon.

Gauguin?s desire to reject Western culture and merge with a naive society for the sake of aesthetic and spiritual inspiration reflects the complex and problematic nature of European ?primitivism.? A concept that emerged at the end of the 19th century, ?primitivism? was motivated by the romantic desire to discover an unsullied paradise hidden within the ?uncivilized? world, as well as by a fascination with what was perceived as the raw, unmediated sensuality of cultural artifacts. This voyeuristic engagement with underdeveloped societies by artists, writers, and philosophers corresponded to French imperialistic practices&#8212;Tahiti, for example, was annexed as a colony in 1881.</p><p>The artist?s idyllic Tahitian landscapes <i>In the Vanilla Grove, Man and Horse</i> and <i>Haere Mai</i> reveal the contradictions between myth and reality that are inherent to ?primitivism.? Both canvases probably depict the area surrounding Mataiea, the small village in which Gauguin settled during the fall of 1891. As richly hued tapestries of flattened forms, they are, however, only evocations of the lush Tahitian terrain, reflecting the simplicity of form sought by the artist during his first visit to the island. Gauguin derived the pose of the man and horse in <i>In the Vanilla Grove</i> not from a scene he found in Tahiti but from a frieze on the quintessential monument of Western culture, the Parthenon.

When he stepped off the train in the southern city, however, he was confronted by a snowy landscape, the result of a record cold spell. Undaunted, Van Gogh painted <i>Landscape with Snow</i> around February 24, when the snow had mostly melted, just prior to a new inundation.&#185; The artist implies the patchy coverage of the snow through daubs of brown paint and by leaving areas of the canvas to the brilliant illumination and feverish colors of the summer harvest paintings Van Gogh made later in the year. Here, instead, he presents the looming, purplish light of an impending snowstorm.</p><p>A great admirer of Japanese art, Van Gogh went to Arles hoping to establish an artistic community in an environment commensurate with his Oriental ideal. He wrote to his brother, Theo, from Arles, ?But for my part I foresee that other artists will want to see color under a stronger sun, and in a more Japanese clarity of light.?&#178; This painting may have been inspired by the snowy scenes common to the Japanese prints Van Gogh avidly collected, but it also follows conventions of seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting in its gradation of color from dark greens and browns framing the foreground to blue sky in the distance, and through the diagonal recession of the road in the snowy landscape. But, unlike Dutch panoramas with their broad expanse of sky, the present work shows Van Gogh concentrating on the terrain between where he stands and the bright red-roofed cottage in the distance. He paints the scene from a perspective immersed in the landscape, on the same plane as the black-hatted man and bowlegged dog trudging along the path.</p><p>This canvas and a similar one painted a day or so later, <i>Snowy Landscape with Arles in the Background</i> (private collection, London), are less detailed than the more elaborate and descriptive landscapes Van Gogh made a few months later, thus suggesting the artist?s tentative approach to his recently chosen home.</p><p>Jennifer Blessing</p><p>1.

During that summer he painted a number of portraits of locals who posed for him, including a member of the Zouave, a French infantry unit originally composed of Algerian soldiers. At the end of July and beginning of August, he created some of his most accomplished drawings, renditions of paintings he had recently made. In <em>The Zouave</em>, he carefully translated the expressiveness of his striking color combinations and bold brushstrokes through the variety and density of contrasting marks, including dots, striations, and intense crosshatching.</p><p>Eager for his friend Paul Gauguin to join him in Arles, Van Gogh sent this drawing and several others to the artist John Peter Russell, ostensibly as a pretext to ask Russell to buy a Gauguin painting. Though this never happened, Gauguin arrived in Arles in October; subsequently Van Gogh became progressively more agitated, resulting in a breakdown and Gauguin&rsquo;s departure in December. In the years prior to his suicide in 1890, Van Gogh suffered increasingly frequent attacks of mental distress, the cause of which remains unclear. <em>Mountains at Saint-R&#233;my</em> (<em>Montagnes &#224; Saint-R&#233;my</em>) was painted in July 1889, when he was trying to recuperate at the hospital of Saint-Paulde-Mausole in the town of Saint-R&#233;my, not far from Arles. The painting represents the Alpilles, a low range of mountains visible from the hospital grounds.

In one note he wrote, &ldquo;I rather like the &lsquo;Entrance to a Quarry&rsquo;&#8212;I was doing it when I felt this attack coming on&#8212;because to my mind the somber greens go well with the ocher tones; there is something sad in it which is healthy, and that is why it does not bore me.

Unlike the earlier Impressionists, who often painted urban life, the artist felt that the city, in particular Paris, was a place of iniquity, inherently unhealthful. In the face of industrialization and modernization (the Eiffel Tower was built the same year that this canvas was painted), Van Gogh longed nostalgically for a rural environment peopled with good-natured, God-fearing peasants such as those painted by Jean-Fran&#231;ois Millet, one of his heroes. This utopian ideal, based on a belief in the regenerative capacity of a ?primitive? culture, was shared by Van Gogh?s friend Paul Gauguin, who sought redemption farther from home, among the people of Tahiti.</p><p>Jennifer Blessing</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

Though painted in Munich two years after Kandinsky lived and worked in Paris from 1906 to 1907, this canvas attests to his appreciation of modern French art. The plein-air social gathering of men and women dressed in Biedermeier fashion is reminiscent of Manet?s portrait of leisure life, <i>Music in the Tuileries</i>. Kandinsky admired Manet?s work for what he construed to be an emphasis on painting itself rather than a mimetic translation of the empirical world. While the content of <i>Group in Crinolines</i> may resemble that of nineteenth-century Impressionist scenes, its brilliant, radical color scheme is clearly Fauvist in inspiration. During his stay in Paris, Kandinsky exhibited at the Salon d?Automne of 1906 in which Matisse and the Fauves were prominently featured.

He valued painterly abstraction as the most effective stylistic means through which to reveal hidden aspects of the empirical world, express subjective realities, aspire to the metaphysical, and offer a regenerative vision of the future.

The inner vision of an artist, he believed, could thereby be translated into a universally accessible statement.</p><p>He realized, however, that it would be necessary to develop such a style slowly in order to foster public acceptance and comprehension. Therefore, in most of his work from this period he retained fragments of recognizable imagery. ?We are still firmly bound to the outward appearance of nature and must draw forms from it,? he wrote in his essay ?Picture with the White Edge,? but suggested that there existed a hidden pictorial construction that would ?emerge unnoticed from the picture and [would thus be] less suited to the eye than the soul.? <i>Painting with White Border</i>, for instance, was explained by Kandinsky as a response to ?those . . . extremely powerful impressions I had experienced in Moscow&#8212;or more correctly, of Moscow itself.? To illustrate the spirit of the city, Kandinsky included an extremely abbreviated image of a Russian troika driven by a trio of horses (the three diagonal black lines in the upper-left portion of the canvas).

The landscapes inspired by these Alpine surroundings developed from the flattened, densely colored views of 1908 to the luminous, antimaterial dream visions of 1913, such as this canvas and the closely related <i>Landscape with Red Spots, No. 1</i> (Collection Museum Folkwang, Essen).</p><p>The motif of the church in a landscape recurs often in Kandinsky?s paintings of 1908&#8211;13. In examples of 1908&#8211;09 the particular design of the Murnau church makes identification possible, though the local topography may not be accurately reflected. By 1911 there is little specifying detail, and the tower, which serves to divide the composition, has taken on a generalized, columnar appearance. In <i>Landscape with Red Spots, No. 2</i> the tower is replaced by a mysterious elongated vertical form that seems to continue beyond the canvas edge into another realm. Like the nineteenth-century German Romantic painters, Kandinsky presents the landscape as an exalted, spiritualized vision. He achieves the sublimity of the image by freeing color from its descriptive function to reveal its latent expressive content. The chromatic emphasis is on the primary colors, applied thinly over a white ground. The focal point, the red spot that inspires the picture?s title, bears out Kandinsky?s appraisal of red as an expanding color that pulses forward toward the viewer, in contrast to cooler colors, particularly blue, that recede. Kandinsky indicates the naturalistic content of subject matter with abbreviated signs, emphasizing the purely pictorial aspects of color and form, and thus is able to dematerialize the objective world.</p><p>Lucy Flint',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

From this time geometric shapes became increasingly prevalent in his work, often floating in front of or within a broad plane, as in <i>White Cross</i>. Here straight lines and circles offset looser, organic forms and irregularly geometric shapes. A corresponding variation of brushstroke produces highly active passages contrasting with less inflected areas. Some shapes may have their distant origins in a naturalistic vocabulary of forms. Thus, the fishlike crescent and the lancing black diagonal that crosses it, which appear also in the related <i>Red Oval</i> of 1920 (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York), may recall the boat with oars in earlier works. However, the motifs are stripped of their representational meaning and do not contribute to an interpretation of the whole in terms of realistic content.</p><p>The title isolates a detail of the composition, the white cross at upper right, a formal consequence of the checkerboard pattern (a recurrent motif in works of this period). In this instance negative space is treated as positive form. Once the cross of the title is seen, one begins to perceive throughout the work a proliferation of others, varying in degrees of explicitness. Though Kandinsky, like Kazimir Malevich, uses it as an abstract element, the cross is an evocative, symbolic form.</p><p>The viewer?s compulsion to read imagery literally is used to unexpected ends by Kandinsky, who includes two signs resembling the numeral 3 upended and affixed to directional arrows. The variations in direction of the resulting forms suggest the rotation of the entire canvas. The antigravitational feeling of floating forms and the placement of elements on a planar support against an indefinite background in <i>White Cross</i> reveal affinities with Malevich?s Suprematist works.</p><p>Lucy Flint',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

This conflict led him to return to Germany in 1921. <i>In the Black Square</i>, executed two years later, epitomizes Kandinsky?s synthesis of Russian avant-garde art and his own lyrical abstraction: the white trapezoid recalls Malevich?s Suprematist paintings, but the dynamic compositional elements, resembling clouds, mountains, sun, and a rainbow, still refer to the landscape.</p><p>In 1922 Kandinsky joined the faculty of the Weimar Bauhaus, where he discovered a more sympathetic environment in which to pursue his art. Originally premised on a Germanic, expressionistic approach to artmaking, the Bauhaus aesthetic came to reflect Constructivist concerns and styles, which by the mid-1920s had become international in scope. While there, Kandinsky furthered his investigations into the correspondence between colors and forms and their psychological and spiritual effects. In <i>Composition 8</i>, the colorful, interactive geometric forms create a pulsating surface that is alternately dynamic and calm, aggressive and quiet. The importance of circles in this painting prefigures the dominant role they would play in many subsequent works, culminating in his cosmic and harmonious image <i>Several Circles</i>. ?The circle,? claimed Kandinsky, ?is the synthesis of the greatest oppositions. It combines the concentric and the eccentric in a single form and in equilibrium. Of the three primary forms, it points most clearly to the fourth dimension.?</p><p>Nancy Spector',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:55');

A partial circle rests delicately on a pointed base. Another fragment of a circle glides along its vertical diameter, reaching beyond the circumference of the first form to penetrate the space above it. Vasily Kandinsky achieves an effect of energy rising upward, while anchoring the forms together by balancing them on either side of a continuous vertical line. In a closely related work of the same period, <i>Depressed</i> (Collection Galleria Marescalchi, Bologna), Kandinsky distributes motifs of partial circles horizontally. Here he represses the sense of energy found in <i>Upward</i> both through his composition and a subdued palette.</p><p>A linear design in the upper right corner of the present canvas echoes the vertical thrust of the central motif. This configuration resembles the letter E, as does the black cutout shape at the base of the central motif. Another E shape is legible in the upper right corner of a related drawing (Collection Mus&#233;e National d?Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris). These forms may at once be independent designs and playful references to the first letter of <i>Empor</i>, the German title of the painting.</p><p>The related drawing reveals that the small black circle and the horizontal bars of the central motif, which have the physiognomic character of eye and mouth, were not part of Kandinsky?s original design concept and evolved as he worked on the painting. As he wrote in 1929, the year he painted <i>Upward</i>, ?I do not choose form consciously; it chooses itself within me.?&#185; The physiognomic character of <i>Upward</i> indicates Kandinsky?s association at the Dessau Bauhaus with fellow Blaue Vier artists Paul Klee and Alexej Jawlensky. Jawlensky showed sixteen abstract heads, a motif that appeared in his work as early as 1918, in an exhibition of the Blaue Vier at the Galerie Ferdinand M&#246;ller in Berlin in October 1929. Shown during the month when <i>Upward</i> was completed, these paintings offered Kandinsky the model of large, abstract faces composed of geometric planes of non-naturalistic color and accented by bar-shaped features. However, Kandinsky?s working method more closely resembled that of Klee, who began with intuitively chosen forms that gradually suggested counterparts in the natural world, than that of Jawlensky, who began with the model and moved toward abstraction. In particular, the whimsy of the hovering black eye in <i>Upward</i> and the incorporation of a letter as a pictogram with a possible reference to the title of the painting suggest the reverberations of Klee?s art.</p><p>Elizabeth C.

His late works are marked by a general lightening of palette and the introduction of organic imagery; breaking away from the rigidity of Bauhaus geometry, he turned to the softer, more malleable shapes used by Paris-based artists associated with Surrealism, such as Jean Arp and Joan Mir&#243;. Kandinsky?s late, often whimsical, paintings were also influenced by the playful, intricately detailed compositions of his longtime friend and Bauhaus colleague Paul Klee.</p><p>During his first years in France, Kandinsky experimented with pigments mixed with sand, a technical innovation practiced during the 1930s by many Parisian artists, including Andr&#233; Masson and Georges Braque. Although Kandinsky utilized this method only until 1936, he created several paintings with rich, textured surfaces such as <i>Accompanied Contrast</i>, in which the interconnected colored planes and smaller floating patterns project slightly from the canvas. Always attentive to and appreciative of contemporary stylistic innovations, Kandinsky inevitably brought his own interests to bear on any aspects he would borrow. As art historian Vivian Barnett has pointed out, his employment of biomorphic forms&#8212;a motif favored by Surrealist painters as well as by Klee&#8212;attests more to his fascination with the organic sciences themselves, particularly embryology, zoology, and botany. During his Bauhaus years, Kandinsky had clipped and mounted illustrations of microscopic organisms, insects, and embryos from scientific journals for pedagogical purposes and study. He also owned several important sourcebooks and encyclopedias from which depictions of minuscule creatures found abstract equivalences in his late paintings. A schematized pink-toned embryo, for instance, floats in the upper-right corner of <i>Dominant Curve</i>, while the figures contained within the green rectangle in the upper-left corner resemble microscopic marine animals. <i>Various Actions</i> is imbued with similar organic figures hovering above a celestial blue field. These buoyant, biomorphic images, often presented in pastel hues, may be read as signs of Kandinsky?s optimistic vision of a peaceful future and hope for postwar rebirth and regeneration.</p><p>Nancy Spector',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:58');

Similarly, it is easy to forget that Monet?s Venetian paintings succeeded by just a couple of years the full-fledged explosion of colors that took place at the hands of Andr&#233; Derain, Henri Matisse, and Maurice de Vlaminck during their short-lived Fauve episode in 1905&#8211;06. Arguably, Monet?s high-pitched and color-saturated views of Venice owe more to Derain?s paintings of London of 1905&#8211;06 (such as <i>Big Ben</i>, 1905, Mus&#233;e d?art Moderne de Troyes) than to his own early Impressionist scenes of that city, made in 1870&#8211;71. Reciprocally, these paintings by Derain had been prompted by Monet?s views of the Thames, begun in 1899 and exhibited at the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris in 1904. These mutual interactions, which paved the way toward the series of views of Venice, situate Monet?s artistic production at the dawn of the twentieth century within a broad Modernist canon&#8212;rather than in a languishing and aging Impressionist idiom.</p><p>Of the three dozen paintings that Monet produced in Venice in 1908, twenty-nine were exhibited for the first time as a series&#8212;or, more accurately, as a group of series&#8212;at the gallery Bernheim-Jeune in Paris from May 28 to June 8, 1912. Monet?s exhibition was hailed as a triumph by most critics, who did not fail to draw a connection between his work and early modernism. Guillaume Apollinaire, the poet, art critic, and great champion of Cubism, was laudatory about Monet. To Apollinaire?s eye, Cubism was a pure, lucid art that did not attempt to transmit a ?visual perception? of any object, but ?to give an idea, i.e., the objective truth? of that object.&#185; It was around this same notion of ?truthfulness? that Apollinaire praised Monet?s views of Venice, writing that this ?concern for truth? led the viewer to understand Venice apart from its mythical status and reduced to its reality: canals seen through mist or haze. The artist?s views of the city are animated by his desire to get down to the bare essentials of what he selected to look at. Venice was, for him, a return to basic materials&#8212;stones, light, water, mist&#8212;each interacting with the other to produce a mosaic of suffused iridescent hues that saturate the entire surface of the canvas. Never before had Venice been so severely stripped of all its mythical attributes; never had the materiality of the air and the haze and their colors coalesced into something as real&#8212;as truthful&#8212;as they did in Monet?s paintings.</p><p>Joachim Pissarro</p><p>1.

During the course of his two-month stay he immersed himself in art galleries as well as the bohemian caf&#233;s, night-clubs, and dance halls of Montmartre. <i>Le Moulin de la Galette</i>, his first Parisian painting, reflects his fascination with the lusty decadence and gaudy glamour of the famous dance hall, where bourgeois patrons and prostitutes rubbed shoulders.

Reproductions of his expressive paintings appeared in French newspapers that circulated in Barcelona and were well known to Picasso before he came to Paris, but the firsthand experience of these canvases and the decadent culture they portrayed increased his admiration for Toulouse-Lautrec and the tradition in which they were painted. In <i>Le Moulin de la Galette</i>, Picasso adopted the position of a sympathetic and intrigued observer of the spectacle of entertainment, suggesting its provocative appeal and artificiality. In richly vibrant colors, much brighter than any he had previously used, he captured the intoxicating scene as a dizzying blur of fashionable figures with expressionless faces.</p><p>Jan Avgikos',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Estate of Pablo Picasso/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

Though naturalistically delineated, the painting presages his imminent experiments with abstraction.</p><p>Nancy Spector',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Estate of Pablo Picasso/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

A decisive moment in its development occurred during the summer of 1911, when Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso painted side by side in C&#233;ret, in the French Pyrenees, each artist producing paintings that are difficult&#8212;sometimes virtually impossible&#8212;to distinguish from those of the other.</p><p>Picasso?s still life <i>Carafe, Jug, and Fruit Bowl</i>, painted two summers before, shows an earlier stage of this style. Surfaces are broken into sharply defined planes but are not yet complexly fragmented; forms still retain an illusion of volume; and perspective, though dramatically shortened, is not obliterated. At its climax, Braque and Picasso brought Analytic Cubism almost to the point of complete abstraction. Among such works is Picasso?s <i>Accordionist</i>, a baffling composition that one of its former owners mistook for a landscape because of the inscription ?C&#233;ret? on the reverse. With diligence, one can distinguish the general outlines of the seated accordionist, denoted by a series of shifting vertically aligned triangular planes, semicircular shapes, and right angles; the centrally located folds of the accordion and its keys; and, in the lower portion of the canvas, the volutes of an armchair. But Picasso?s elusive references to recognizable forms and objects cannot always be precisely identified and, as the Museum of Modern Art?s founding director Alfred H. Barr, Jr. observed, ?the mysterious tension between painted image and ?reality? remains.?</p><p>In <i>Landscape at C&#233;ret</i>, another canvas painted that summer, patches of muted earthy color, schematized stairways, and arched window configurations exist as visual clues that must be pieced together.

Picasso?s subsequent series of nine vibrantly colored still lifes (1924&#8211;25), executed in a bold Synthetic Cubist style of overlapping and contiguous forms, discredited such a judgment and asserted the enduring value of the technique. But the artist was not simply resuscitating his previous discoveries in creating this new work; the rounded, organic shapes and saturated hues attest to his appreciation of contemporary developments in Surrealist painting, particularly as evinced in the work of Andr&#233; Masson and Joan Mir&#243;. The undulating lines, ornamental patterns, and broad chromatic elements of <i>Mandolin and Guitar</i> foretell the emergence of a fully evolved sensual, biomorphic style in Picasso?s art, which would soon celebrate the presence of his new mistress, Marie-Th&#233;r&#232;se Walter.</p><p>When Picasso met Marie-Th&#233;r&#232;se on January 11, 1927 in front of Galeries Lafayette in Paris, she was 17 years old. As he was married at the time and she only a teenager, they were compelled to conceal their intense love affair. While their illicit liaison was hidden from public view, its earliest years are documented, albeit covertly, in Picasso?s work. Five still lifes painted during 1927&#8212;incorporating the monograms ?MT? and ?MTP? as part of their compositions&#8212;cryptically announce the entry of Marie-Th&#233;r&#232;se into the artist?s life. By 1931 explicit references to her fecund, supple body and blond tresses appear in harmonious, voluptuous images such as <i>Woman with Yellow Hair</i>. Marie-Th&#233;r&#232;se became a constant theme; she was portrayed reading, gazing into a mirror, and, most often, sleeping, which for Picasso was the most intimate of depictions.</p><p>The abbreviated delineation of her profile&#8212;a continuous, arched line from forehead to nose&#8212;became Picasso?s emblem for his subject, and appears in numerous sculptures, prints, and paintings of his mistress. Rendered in a sweeping, curvilinear style, this painting of graceful repose is not so much a portrait of Marie-Th&#233;r&#232;se the person as it is Picasso?s abstract, poetic homage to his young muse.</p><p>Nancy Spector',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Estate of Pablo Picasso/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

Jacqueline Roque, whom Picasso met in 1953, became his companion and remained with him throughout the remainder of his life. (Jacqueline?s image permeates his work from 1954 until his death.) In 1955 the couple took up residence in La Californie, an elaborate 19th-century villa overlooking Cannes. These years and events mark the point of departure for the last phases of Picasso?s production.</p><p>In his art of this period, Picasso dedicated himself to the exploration of the subject of painting. Almost systematically, he paints variations on and improvisations of old master paintings, turning to the works of Jacques-Louis David, Eug&#232;ne Delacroix, Edouard Manet, Nicolas Poussin, and Diego Vel&#225;zquez, among others. As art historian David Sylvester suggested, Picasso entered a friendly but competitive dialogue with the paintings of the past. Picasso himself admitted in a note written on the inside back cover of a sketchbook that, ?Painting is stronger than I am; it makes me do whatever it wants.?</p><p>Painted in an expressionist manner, <i>Two Doves with Wings Spread</i> and a later, second version were completed while Picasso was staying at La Californie, where he had built a dovecote on the third-floor balcony. Doves and pigeons figure in a number of works in Picasso?s oeuvre (and interestingly, in that of his father, Jos&#233; Ruiz Blasco), such as his poster depicting a dove for the 1948 Peace Congress and several ceramic works from 1953.</p><p>The last twenty years of Picasso?s life are marked as much by the enormous number of canvases the artist produced as by the controversial reception of these works. Criticized for the pictorial shorthand he developed to preserve the spontaneity and expressive value of his work, this period of Picasso?s production is often neglected. However, as has been suggested, Picasso?s formal explorations&#8212;a brushstroke that is sometimes stenographic and abbreviated, or frequently thick and flowing&#8212;is a continuation of the artist?s lifelong challenge to stylistic convention, and evidence of his drive to convey vitality, liberation, and the desire to make fewer decisions as a defense against the fleeting nature of time: ?I have less and less time and I have more and more to say.?</p><p>Tracey Bashkoff',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Estate of Pablo Picasso/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

The painting demonstrates Picasso?s ability to derive serious implications from what is essentially humorous. The subject of the lobster and cat refers to one of the most beloved paintings of French art, Jean-Baptiste-Sim&#233;on Chardin?s <i>The Ray</i> (1728, Mus&#233;e du Louvre, Paris). In both paintings, a cat is aroused to vicious hissing by the menacing aspect of an item of seafood that is as delicious to the palate as it is horrendous to the eye.</p><p>What is so astonishing in Picasso?s painting is that he is able to retain the humorously anecdotal premise of the eighteenth-century genre painting while simultaneously heightening the encounter between cat and lobster into a miniature but extremely effective metaphor of aggression aroused by fear. It is a theme that preoccupied Picasso. If one makes all due allowances for the differences between the categories of miniature and monumental expression, it is a theme that also occurs in Picasso?s great mural <i>Guernica</i> (1937, Reina Sof&#237;a, Madrid). The comparison strikes an absurd note until one remembers Picasso?s frequent shifts from monumental to miniature, from trifling to significant and back again. These ostensibly erratic whimsicalities aim at an ironic demonstration of the artificial conventions of our thought and of our feelings. Here again, as in <i>Lobster and Cat</i> and in so much of Picasso?s work, it is impossible to think of <i>Guernica</i>?s bull or horse as being either all good or all evil, so is it impossible (on quite a different level of seriousness, of course) to come to a clear decision regarding the lobster and the cat in the Thannhauser painting. Both animals are potentially as innocent as they are dangerous.</p><p>Fred Licht',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Estate of Pablo Picasso/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

Camille Pissarro lived there on and off between 1866 and 1883, choosing the rural environs of the provincial capital for a series of large-scale landscapes that have been called his early masterpieces. Pissarro?s idyll, replete with villagers and neatly tended gardens, is more than just the naturalist painter?s attention to perceived reality. It is a continuation of the French academic landscape tradition, which stretched from the allegories of Poussin to the proto-Cubist landscapes of Paul C&#233;zanne, who studied and worked with Pissarro.</p><p>Pissarro stripped his painting of the historical or sentimental over-tones that characterized the landscapes of his immediate predecessors. And he made magisterial use of light and dark, demonstrating more than a mere interest in the effects of sun and shade. As art theorist Charles Blanc wrote at the time, this type of articulation was meant ?not simply to give relief to the forms, but to correspond to the sentiment that the painter wishes to express, conforming to the conventions of a moral beauty as much as to the laws of natural truth.?</p><p>The painterly conventions that Pissarro utilized in <i>The Hermitage</i> were established by Gustave Courbet, Edouard Manet, and the Barbizon school, but the painting is also a product of its era. In the same year that Marx published <i>Das Kapital</i>, Pissarro elected to depict a class of people that many critics considered a vulgar choice for the subject of a painting. Pissarro?s later socialist sympathies aside, his work avoided the confines of traditional academic painting, which was centered on scenes far removed from the real world he hoped to describe. <i>The Hermitage</i>, however realistic an arcadian scene it appears to be, belongs to Pissarro?s seemingly unfulfilled quest for a truthful manner of depiction. Shortly afterward he abandoned this Realist style for a looser brush and the atmospheric effects for which he is popularly known, the trademarks of Impressionism.</p><p>Cornelia Lauf',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

He probably executed this picture soon after his return from service in the Franco-Prussian War in March 1871 and certainly before Lise married someone else in April 1872, evidently never to see Renoir again.

He avoids anecdote and innuendo, refuses to pander to the prurient beholder, and in doing so acknowledges his debt to Manet.?&#185;</p><p>The subject of a woman holding a parrot appears in works from the 1860s by Gustave Courbet, Edgar Degas, and Edouard Manet. The formal, static composition and the representation of spatial depth and traditional modeling in Renoir?s painting are consistent with his pictures from the late 1860s and early 1870s. <i>Woman with Parrot</i> clearly predates Renoir?s Impressionist style and does not yet reflect the high-keyed tonality, shimmering patterns of light and spontaneity of mood that would characterize his later work.</p><p>1.

Born in Cuiseaux, France, Vuillard moved to Paris in 1877, eventually attending the Acad&#233;mie Julian and the &#201;cole des Beaux-Arts. Over time he met several of the artists who would become, as he did, members of the Nabis (the prophets). This Post-Impressionist group, which challenged current naturalist impulses and the elitism of easel painting, pursued subject matter infused with suggestive Symbolist themes and a style characterized by intense color, synthetic two-dimensional compositions, and reductive forms, often in large-scale decorative works. Vuillard also was dubbed an Intimist&#8212;along with Nabis members such as Pierre Bonnard and Ker-Xavier Roussel&#8212;because he culled his subject-matter from the intimate world of family life. He habitually depicted his seamstress mother (with whom he lived until her death in 1928) and his sister in claustrophobic images filled with a profusion of patterns: striped dresses, variegated fabrics, and flowered wallpaper.</p><p>During the 1890s, Vuillard frequented the intellectuals, artists, and patrons associated with the avant-garde journal <em>La revue blanche</em>. Following its closure, in 1903, he gained a less radical, if more upper-class, set of friends and patrons. In this period, Vuillard shifted from painting psychologically charged interiors and mural-size outdoor scenes to more schematic bird&rsquo;s-eye perspectives of Paris. In 1908, he embarked on a series of commissioned decorative panels of Place Vintimille, a typical bourgeois Parisian square that he could see from the window of his apartment. In their architectural, screenlike format, the <em>Place Vintimille</em> (1908&#8211;10) panels hearkened back to work Vuillard had done for the theater. They also denoted his ongoing adherence to the decorative aesthetics espoused by the Nabis (which had disbanded in 1899) as well as the formal language of Japanese art, exemplified by the adoption of the screen format, the depiction of asymmetrical views, and the abrupt cropping of forms. Vuillard would continue to paint decorative works for private and public spaces, along with more traditional portraits set in interiors, until the last years of his life.</p><p>Vivien Greene</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© 2012 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAPG, Paris',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:56');

In photographing the already awkward young subjects in their bathing suits, Dijkstra sets up a situation marked by exposure and self-consciousness that parallels the uneasy passage between childhood and adulthood. The images represent individuals from various countries and, as a whole, add up to a meditation on adolescent disconcertment.

A Cuban exile, Mendieta came to the United States in 1961, leaving much of her family behind&mdash;a traumatic cultural separation that had a huge impact on her art. Her earliest performances, made while studying at the University of Iowa, involved manipulations to her body, often in violent contexts, such as restaged rape or murder scenes. In 1973 she began to visit pre-Columbian sites in Mexico to learn more about native Central American and Caribbean religions.

Her <em>Silueta</em> (Silhouette) series (begun in 1973) used a typology of abstracted feminine forms, through which she hoped to access an \"omnipresent female force.\"&sup1; Working in Iowa and Mexico, she carved and shaped her figure into the earth, with arms overhead to represent the merger of earth and sky; floating in water to symbolize the minimal space between land and sea; or with arms raised and legs together to signify a wandering soul. These bodily traces were fashioned from a variety of materials, including flowers, tree branches, moss, gunpowder, and fire, occasionally combined with animals'' hearts or handprints that she branded directly into the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1978 the <em>Siluetas</em> gave way to ancient goddess forms carved into rock, shaped from sand, or incised in clay beds. Mendieta created one group of these works, the <em>Esculturas Rupestres</em> or <em>Rupestrian Sculptures</em>, when she returned to Cuba in 1981. Working in naturally formed limestone grottos in a national park outside Havana where pre-Hispanic peoples once lived, she carved and painted abstract figures she named after goddesses from the Ta&iacute;no and Ciboney cultures. Mendieta meant for these sculptures to be discovered by future visitors to the park, but with erosion and the area''s changing uses, they were ultimately destroyed. Like the <em>Siluetas</em>, these works live on only through the artist''s films and photographs, haunting documents of her ephemeral attempts to seek out, in her words, that \"one universal energy which runs through everything: from insect to man, from man to spectre, from spectre to plant, from plant to galaxy.\"&sup2;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nat Trotman</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

With each new series, she has adjusted her style and technique, producing a diverse body of work that ranges from surreal fantasies to ersatz documentary reportage, from videos and photographs saturated with exaggerated color to grainy black-and-white photogravures. An interest in artifice unites her multiform production. Like a number of artists of her generation, Moffatt rejects transcribing reality in favor of constructing her own, alternative reality. She has been highly receptive to the strategies of popular culture&#8212;to cinema, television, magazines, and advertising.</p><p>Many of Moffatt''s works address themes relating to her native Australia, particularly race relations between Aborigines and whites. In <i>Night Cries: A Rural Tradegy</i> (1989), the first film that won her widespread attention, Moffatt focused on the complex relationship between an adult Aboriginal woman and her dying white foster mother. This piece refers to Australia''s \"stolen generation\"&#8212;the thousands of Aboriginal children who were removed from their families and placed into white households up through the 1960s&#8212land is partly rooted in Moffatt''s own childhood experience; half-Aboriginal, she was herself raised by a white foster family in Brisbane. But Moffatt rejects autobiographical readings of her work as reductive. Her work engages larger, more universal themes of race, sexuality, identity, and family.</p><p><i>Scarred for Life</i> (1994) one of Moffatt''s best-known series, comprises nine images featuring children or adolescents, both Aboriginal and white, in suburban settings. Each image records a different trauma inflicted by parents or by older siblings, from verbal to physical abuse. The individuals pictured are actors, selected and arranged by the artist, but Moffatt places them within a documentary format: the staged tableaux, which are printed as photolithographs in muted colors on cream paper and accompanied by short, neutral captions, simulate pages of <i>Life</i> magazine from the 1960s. This deadpan journalistic presentation is jarringly at odds with the deeply intimate, often painful subject matter. At the same time, the images have an informal, snapshot appearance and cover a broad range of past dates (from 1956 to 1977) as if they were pages from a family photo album. A series of deliberately ambiguous and open-ended mini-narratives, <i>Scarred for Life</i> evokes the fragmented nature of memory and, as implied in the title, the way in which injuries from our childhood years remain with us throughout our adult lives.</p><p>&#8212;Ted Mann',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'© Tracey Moffatt',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:57');

He grew up in Le Havre and studied evenings at the &#201;cole des Beaux-Arts there from about 1897 to 1899. He left for Paris to study under a master decorator to receive his craftsman certificate in 1901. From 1902 to 1904 he painted at the Acad&#233;mie Humbert in Paris, where he met Marie Laurencin and Francis Picabia. By 1906 Braque?s work was no longer Impressionist but Fauve in style; after spending that summer in Antwerp with Othon Friesz, he showed his Fauve work the following year in the Salon des Ind&#233;pendants in Paris. His first solo show was at Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler?s gallery in 1908. From 1909 Pablo Picasso and Braque worked together in developing Cubism; by 1911 their styles were extremely similar. In 1912 they started to incorporate collage elements into their paintings and to experiment with the <i>papier coll&#233;</i> (pasted paper) technique. Their artistic collaboration lasted until 1914. Braque served in the French army during World War I and was wounded; upon his recovery in 1917 he began a close friendship with Juan Gris.</p><p>After World War I Braque?s work became freer and less schematic. His fame grew in 1922 as a result of an exhibition at the Salon d?Automne in Paris. In the mid-1920s Braque designed the decor for two Sergei Diaghilev ballets. By the end of the decade, he had returned to a more realistic interpretation of nature, although certain aspects of Cubism always remained present in his work. In 1931 Braque made his first engraved plasters and began to portray mythological subjects. His first important retrospective took place in 1933 at the Kunsthalle Basel. He won first prize at the <i>Carnegie International</i>, Pittsburgh, in 1937.</p><p>During World War II Braque remained in Paris. His paintings at that time, primarily still lifes and interiors, became more somber. In addition to paintings, Braque also made lithographs, engravings, and sculptures. From the late 1940s he treated various recurring themes such as birds, ateliers, landscapes, and seascapes. In 1954 he designed stained-glass windows for the church of Varengeville. During the last few years of his life, Braque?s ill health prevented him from undertaking further large-scale commissions, but he continued to paint, make lithographs, and design jewelry. He died on August 31, 1963, in Paris.</p>','2007-10-15',NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:37');

While in school, he enrolled in the free-drawing academy in Aix, which he attended intermittently for several years. In 1858 he graduated from the Coll&#232;ge Bourbon, where he had become an intimate friend of fellow student Emile Zola. C&#233;zanne entered the law school of the University of Aix in 1859 to placate his father but abandoned his studies to join Zola in Paris in 1861. For the next twenty years C&#233;zanne divided his time between the Midi and Paris. While in the capital, he briefly attended the Atelier Suisse with Camille Pissarro, whose art later came to influence his own. In 1862 C&#233;zanne began long friendships with Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. His paintings were included in the 1863 Salon des Refus&#233;s, which displayed works not accepted by the jury of the official Paris Salon. The Salon itself rejected C&#233;zanne?s submissions each year from 1864 to 1869.</p><p>Following the declaration of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, C&#233;zanne left Paris for Aix-en-Provence and then nearby L?Estaque, where he continued to paint. He made the first of several visits to Pontoise in 1872; there, he worked alongside Pissarro. He participated in the first Impressionist exhibition of 1874. From 1876 to 1879 his works were again rejected by the Salon. C&#233;zanne showed again with the Impressionists in 1877 in their third exhibition. At that time, Georges Rivi&#232;re was one of the few critics to support his art. In 1882 the Salon accepted his work for the first and only time. Beginning in 1883 C&#233;zanne resided in the South of France, returning to Paris occasionally.</p><p>In 1890 C&#233;zanne exhibited with the group Les Vingt in Brussels and spent five months in Switzerland. He traveled to Giverny in 1894 to visit Monet, who introduced him to Auguste Rodin and the critic Gustave Geffroy. C&#233;zanne?s first solo show was held at Ambroise Vollard?s gallery in Paris in 1895. From then on he received increasing recognition, and in 1899 he participated in the Salon des Ind&#233;pendants in Paris for the first time. The following year he took part in the <i>Centennial Exhibition</i> in Paris. In 1903 the Berlin and Vienna Secessions included C&#233;zanne?s work, and in 1904 he exhibited at the Salon d?Automne, Paris. That same year he was given a solo exhibition at the Galerie Cassirer, Berlin. C&#233;zanne died on October 22, 1906, in Aix-en-Provence.</p>','2007-10-16',NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:37');

She studied photography at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam from 1981 to 1986. Through the late 1980s, she photographed people in clubs for magazines in the Netherlands and worked for corporations as a portraitist. In 1990 she injured her hip when her car was struck by a bicycle. A self-portrait produced during her rehabilitation, in which she is seen having just emerged from a pool, exhausted, sparked a new direction in her work. Commissioned by a Dutch newspaper to make photographs based on the notion of summertime, Dijkstra took provocative photographs of adolescent bathers. These ultimately formed her breakthrough <i>Beaches series</i> (1992&#8211;96), which featured her young subjects in different locations in the United States and Europe. From this point on, people in transitional moments would be a major theme in her work. In 1994 she photographed mothers in the moments after giving birth and bullfighters about to enter the arena; she also commenced a series of images of Almerisa, an adolescent Bosnian refugee, whom she continued to photograph until 2003. Dijkstra ventured into video with <i>The Buzz Club</i>, <i>Liverpool, UK/Mysteryworld</i>, <i>Zaandam, NL</i>, taping adolescents at raves between 1996 and 1997. She has also focused on particular individuals entering the military, as in her images of Olivier Silva, a French Foreign Legionnaire (2000&#8211;01), and new inductees into the Israeli army (2002&#8211;03). For the series <i>Park Portraits</i> (2003&#8211;06), Dijkstra photographed children, adolescents, and teenagers momentarily suspending their varied activities to stare into the lens from scenic spots in Amsterdam&#8217;s Vondelpark, Brooklyn&#8217;s Prospect Park, Madrid&#8217;s El Parque del Retiro, and Xiamen&#8217;s Amoy Botanical Garden, among others.<br><br>Since her first solo exhibition, at de Moor in Amsterdam in 1984, Dijkstra has shown at the Sprengel Museum Hannover (1998), Museu d&#8217;Art Contemporani de Barcelona (1999), Art Institute of Chicago (2001), Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (2005), and the Rudolfinum in Prague (2006), among other venues. She has also exhibited widely in group shows, including the Venice Biennale (1997 and 2001), Bienal de S&#227;o Paulo (1998), Biennale Internationale di Fotografia in Turin (1999), International Month of Photography in Moscow (2000), ICP Triennial of Photography and Video at the International Center of Photography in New York (2003), <i>Out of Time</i> at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (2006), and <i>Family Pictures</i> at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (2007). She has received much recognition for her work, winning the Kodak Award Nederland in 1987, the Art Encouragement Award Amstelveen in 1993, the Werner Mantz Award in 1994, and the Citibank Private Bank Photography Prize in 1998.

He began working with Camille Pissarro in 1874 and showed in every Impressionist exhibition between 1879 and 1886. By 1884 Gauguin had moved with his family to Copenhagen, where he unsuccessfully pursued a business career. He returned to Paris in 1885 to paint full-time, leaving his family in Denmark.</p><p>In 1885 Gauguin met Edgar Degas; the next year he met Charles Laval and Emile Bernard in Pont-Aven and Vincent van Gogh in Paris. With Laval he traveled to Panama and Martinique in 1887 in search of more exotic subject matter. Increasingly, Gauguin turned to primitive cultures for inspiration. The following year in Brittany he met Paul S&#233;rusier and renewed his acquaintance with Bernard. As self-designated Synthetists, they were welcomed in Paris by the Symbolist literary and artistic circle. Gauguin organized a group exhibition of their work at the Caf&#233; Volpini, Paris, in 1889, in conjunction with the World?s Fair.</p><p>In 1891 Gauguin auctioned his paintings to raise money for a voyage to Tahiti, which he undertook that same year.

In 1911 Kandinsky and Franz Marc began to make plans for <i>Der Blaue Reiter Almanac</i>, although the publication would not appear until the following year. Kandinsky?s <i>On the Spiritual in Art</i> was published in December 1911. He and Marc withdrew from the NKVM in that month, and shortly thereafter the Blaue Reiter group?s first exhibition was held at the Moderne Galerie. In 1912 the second Blaue Reiter show was held at the Galerie Hans Goltz, Munich. Kandinsky?s first solo show was held at Der Sturm gallery in Berlin in 1912. In 1913 one of his works was included in the Armory Show in New York and the <i>Erste deutsche Herbstsalon</i> at the Der Sturm gallery in Berlin.

After he left Couture?s studio, Manet traveled extensively in Europe, visiting Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Italy. In 1859 he was rejected by the official Paris Salon, although Eug&#232;ne Delacroix intervened on his behalf. In 1861 Manet?s paintings were accepted by the Salon and received favorable press, and he began exhibiting at the Galerie Martinet in Paris. During the early 1860s his friendships with Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Degas began. The three paintings Manet sent to the Salon of 1863, including <i>Le D&#233;jeuner sur l?herbe</i>, were relegated to the Salon des Refus&#233;s, where they attracted the attention of the critic Th&#233;ophile Thor&#233;.</p><p>In 1865 Manet?s <i>Olympia</i> and <i>Christ Mocked</i> were greeted with great hostility when shown at the Salon.

In 1867 Zola published a longer article on Manet, who that year exhibited his work in an independent pavilion at the Paris World?s Fair.

He spent his childhood in the Normandy coastal town of Le Havre, where his father prospered as a grocer and ship chandler. In 1860 Monet met the landscape artist Eug&#232;ne Boudin, who introduced him to plein-air painting, and he began to produce increasingly ambitious and naturalistic work.</p><p>In 1859 Monet moved to Paris, where he attended the Acad&#233;mie Suisse beginning in 1860. He returned to Le Havre in 1862 and worked in the plein-air mode alongside Boudin and Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind. In 1862 he returned to Paris to enroll in the studio of Charles Gleyre, where his fellow students included Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Bazille and Alfred Sisley. Despite some success in 1865, when two of his works were exhibited at the Salon, by 1867 financial difficulties forced Monet to return to his family in Le Havre, leaving his pregnant companion, Camille-L&#233;onie Doncieux, in Paris, where she gave birth to their first son, Jean. The couple were married in 1870; soon after, in response to the Franco-Prussian War, they left for London. There Monet met Paul Durand-Ruel, who would later become his gallerist and a champion of Impressionism. After returning to France at the end of 1871 Monet and his family settled in Argenteuil.</p><p>In 1874, having banded together with other artists to form the Soci&#233;t&#233; Anonyme des Artistes, Monet submitted his painting <i>Impression, Sunrise</i> (1872, Mus&#233;e Marmottan, Paris) to the group''s first exhibition. The work caused a sensation, and gave a name to the burgeoning movement, when the critic Louis Leroy lampooned the group as ?impressionists,? a term the artists themselves soon adopted without satirical inflection.</p><p>In 1878, with financial troubles looming and his wife gravely ill, the Monets embarked on an unorthodox joint household arrangement in V&#233;theuil with the family of former patron Ernest Hosched&#233;. After Camille?s death, Monet and Alice Hosched&#233; continued to live together, waiting until Ernest Hosched&#233; died before marrying in 1892. Monet continued to exhibit with the Impressionists on an irregular basis, choosing also to show his work at the Salon in 1880, in a solo exhibition at Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris in 1883, and at several of Georges Petit?s Expositions Internationales de Peinture. In 1889 Galerie Georges Petit staged a major retrospective of his work, showing 145 paintings. Two years later Durand-Ruel mounted an exhibition of Monet''s first series paintings, <i>Grainstacks</i>, which were met with great critical acclaim. The artist continued his exploration of series in his paintings of poplars and of the Rouen Cathedral, documenting in a succession of canvases subtle shifts in light or focus.</p><p>By 1890 Monet was financially secure enough to purchase a house at Giverny, later adding adjacent land and installing both the water-lily garden and Japanese bridge, which he would later famously paint in series. Between 1899 and 1901 he made three trips to London to paint views of the Thames River. Over the next decade he completed more series studies of the lily garden at Giverny, which he continued to enlarge. Alice?s death in 1911 was succeeded by that of his elder son in 1914. The following year Monet began work on an expansive new garden studio, in which he would fabricate his <i>Grandes-D&#233;corations</i>, the large-scale water-lily series that would occupy him until his death. He made plans to turn a large number of these works over to the state to be housed in specially built galleries in the Paris Orangerie. The installation of twenty-two paintings opened to the public in May 1927, five months after his death, at the age of eighty-six.</p>','2007-10-22',NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:37');

The son of an academic painter, Jos&#233; Ruiz Blasco, he began to draw at an early age. In 1895 the family moved to Barcelona, and Picasso studied there at La Lonja, the academy of fine arts. His visit to Horta de Ebro from 1898 to 1899 and his association with the group at the caf&#233; Els Quatre Gats in about 1899 were crucial to his early artistic development. Picasso?s first exhibition took place in Barcelona in 1900, and that fall he went to Paris for the first of several stays during the early years of the century. Picasso settled in Paris in April 1904, and his circle of friends soon included Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Gertrude and Leo Stein, as well as two dealers, Ambroise Vollard and Berthe Weill.</p><p>His style developed from the Blue Period (1901&#8211;04) to the Rose Period (1905) to the pivotal work <i>Les Demoiselles d?Avignon</i> (1907), and the subsequent evolution of Cubism from an Analytic phase (ca. 1908&#8211;11) to its Synthetic phase (beginning in 1912&#8211;13). Picasso?s collaboration on ballet and theatrical productions began in 1916. Soon thereafter, his work was characterized by neoclassicism and a renewed interest in drawing and figural representation. In the 1920s the artist and his wife, Olga (whom he had married in 1918), continued to live in Paris, to travel frequently, and to spend their summers at the beach. From 1925 to the 1930s Picasso was involved to a certain degree with the Surrealists, and from the fall of 1931 he was especially interested in making sculpture.

Corot is often considered Pissarro?s most important early influence; Pissarro listed himself as Corot?s pupil in the catalogues to the 1864 and 1865 Paris Salons. While Pissarro was accepted to show at the official Salon throughout the 1860s, in 1863 he participated with Edouard Manet, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, and others in the historic Salon des Refus&#233;s. At the close of the decade, he moved to Louveciennes (near the Seine, twenty miles from Paris). Working in close proximity with Claude Monet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, he began to revise his method of landscape painting, privileging the role of color in his expression of natural phenomena and employing smaller patches of paint. This artistic circle was dispersed by the Franco-Prussian War, which Pissarro fled by moving to London in 1870&#8211;71. There he met Paul Durand-Ruel, the Parisian dealer who would become an ardent supporter of Pissarro and his fellow Impressionists. Pissarro participated in his last official Salon in 1870.</p><p>The years after Pissarro?s return to France were seminal ones. He settled in Pontoise, where he received young artists seeking advice, including Paul C&#233;zanne and Paul Gauguin. He took part in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874.

His penetrating and sometimes disturbing depictions of late 19th-century Parisian society are as much innovative explorations of movement and pictorial space as they are portrayals of contemporary life. Degas was from a privileged background, born of a well-to-do family in Paris. After studying law briefly, he turned to art in 1855, attending the vâcole des Beaux-Arts for a time. While he became associated with the Impressionists, Degas belonged to a slightly older generation of artists, which is apparent in the naturalist style of his early portraits and interiors. But, his quintessential works date from the Impressionist decades of the 1870s and 1880s. Like his cohorts, he cast his gaze upon Paris&#039;s electrifying society of spectacle, painting scenes of the caf&#233;-concert, the opera, and the races. He also looked to those living on the fringes of this world: alienated people drinking absinthe, laundresses, milliners, and prostitutes. Perhaps most recognizable are his ballerinas, seen in dance classes, at rest, rehearsing, and performing.<br /><br />Degas&#039;s formal investigations, however, remained paramount, and his subjects, who often seem caught unaware from unusual angles and in awkward poses, are vehicles for these explorations. Blurred action and dramatic cropping of figures or forms reveal conventions adopted from photography (which he also practiced), signaling the instantaneity that the Impressionists embraced. The cropping, together with his incongruous compositional constructions, was also influenced by the nonillusionistic treatment of space and form of Japanese prints, which had gained popularity in France during the  1860s.<br /><br />In the mid-1880s, his vision began to fail and the more forgiving medium of pastel became increasingly important to Degas, who fully exploited its soft, blurred contours and coloristic effects. Likewise, the medium of sculpture allowed Degas to use his hands rather than his eyes in molding the pliant wax. These sculpted studies of motion parallel contemporaneous examinations of locomotion by photographer Eadweard Muybridge (1830&#8211;1904), whose photographs Degas knew. In these later years, the bather became an increasingly dominant subject of his work. His deteriorating eyesight eventually forced Degas to cease making art sometime between 1910 and 1912.

After graduating, Moffatt moved to Sydney, where she commenced her stylistically diverse body of films and photography that investigate issues such as race, childhood trauma, and the media. In 1996 Moffatt exhibited a series of black-and-white photographs of aboriginal dancers entitled <i>Some Lads</i> (1986) alongside the color photograph <i>The Movie Star</i> (1985). In the latter work, the aboriginal actor David Gulpili drinks a beer and reclines lazily across a car hood, appropriating the stance of white Australian surfers as they are popularly displayed in the media. The photographic series <i>Something More</i> (1989) presents a rich fragmented narrative with suggestive images of violence, glamour, and disappointed dreams. In her film <i>Night Cries: A Rural Tragedy</i> (1989), which brought Moffatt international attention when screened at the Cannes Film Festival, the artist engages with both national and personal history through the complex relationship between an aboriginal woman and her dying white foster mother. In <i>Pet Thang</i> (1991), dreamlike images of a nude woman and a sheep float in the dark. <i>Bedevil</i> (1993), Moffatt&#039;s first feature-length film, narrates several ghost stories passed down to the artist when she was growing up. The photographic series <i>Scarred for Life</i> (1994) depicts childhood and adolescence as times saturated with violence, neglect, and psychological turmoil in the format of old faded <i>Time</i> magazine pages. The artist revisited the style and themes of this work in 1999 with a second version of <i>Scarred for Life</i>. In <i>GUAPA (Goodlooking)</i> (1995), the frenetic world of roller-derby girls is breathlessly suspended in somber, color-drained photographs. In the film <i>Heaven</i> (1997), Moffatt became the ultimate voyeur as she videotaped and goaded male surfers publicly dressing and undressing on Sydney&#039;s Bondi Beach. Moffatt engaged with a new medium in 1998 with her series of photogravures entitled <i>Laudanum</i>. On the occasion of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Moffatt distilled the empty expressions of athletes who ranked an anticlimactic fourth-place in their events. The ten large-scale pieces that comprise Moffatt&#039;s <i>Adventure Series</i> (2004) draw from the melodramatic, hyper-sexualized, and violent world of comics and B-movies. In <i>Under the Sign of Scorpio</i> (2005), Moffatt disguises herself as forty famous women (Catherine Deneuve, Georgia O&#039;Keefe, Bjork, etc.), all born under the sign of Scorpio, posed before various backdrops of romantic splendor or cataclysmic explosions. In her film <i>Doomed</i> (2007), Moffatt spliced together scenes of destruction as dramatized in popular cinema.<br /><br />Solo exhibitions of Moffatt&#039;s work have been organized by the Australian Centre for Photography in Sydney (1989), Artpace in San Antonio (1995), DIA Center for the Arts in New York (1997), Kunsthalle Vienna (1998), Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston (1999), Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney (2003&#8211;04), and Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (2005). Her works have also been included in important group exhibitions like the Sydney Biennial (1993, 2000, and 2008) Venice Biennale (1997), S&#227;o Paulo Bienal (1996 and 1998), Prague Biennale (2005), <i>Family Pictures</i> at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (2007), and Liverpool Biennial (2008). In 2007 she was awarded the Infinity Award for Excellence in Photography by the International Center for Photography in New York.

In 1877 the family moved to Paris. There Vuillard attended the Lyc&#233;e Condorcet, where he befriended the future artists Maurice Denis and Ker-Xavier Roussel. After leaving school in 1885, he joined Roussel (who would later become his brother-in-law) at the studio of the painter Diog&#232;ne Maillart. Vuillard then attended the Acad&#233;mie Julian in Paris for about a year, before passing the entrance exam for the Acad&#233;mie des Beaux-Arts in July 1887. Vuillard&rsquo;s studies at the Acad&#233;mie Julian would have more of an impact on his work than his intermittent studies at the Acad&#233;mie des Beaux-Arts, however, as it was there that Vuillard met Pierre Bonnard, Paul S&#233;rusier, and F&#233;lix Vallotton, and in 1889 joined the Nabis, a group of dissident students led by S&#233;rusier.</p>\r\n<p>The Nabis, whose name is derived from the Hebrew word for &ldquo;prophet,&rdquo; were determined to rid their art of any trace of academicism. S&#233;rusier&rsquo;s <em>The Talisman, the Aven River at the Bois d&rsquo;Amour</em> (<em>Le Talisman, l&rsquo;Aven au Bois d&rsquo;Amour</em>) of 1888, executed using the color theory and artistic philosophy of Paul Gauguin, became a kind of manifesto under which the group operated. Its abstracted forms and Synthetist color are mirrored in Vuillard&rsquo;s work from 1890 on, when he was finally able to shake off the high finish and technical precision of his realist artistic training. Unlike some of his fellow Nabis, who were more closely drawn to theological or mythical subject matter, Vuillard focused mainly on women in domestic interiors, which would serve as his primary subject throughout the rest of his life. In 1892 and after, his work became elaborately patterned and mutely colored.</p> \n\n<p>During the 1890s Vuillard&rsquo;s association with the anarchist journal <em>La revue blanche</em> led to several important decorative commissions from its editors, the brothers Thad&#233;e and Alexandre Natanson. In 1900 he met Lucie Hessel, whose husband, Jos Hessel, was his dealer at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Madame Hessel would become Vuillard&rsquo;s model and close friend for the next four decades. In later years Vuillard moved toward a more luminous style influenced by Impressionism, but his work nevertheless retained the flat, decorative quality of Nabi painting. He died in La Baule, near Saint-Nazaire, while making his way to Hessel&rsquo;s seaside home, on June 21, 1940.</p>','2011-01-19',NULL,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:37');

At the age of 12, after her father joined anti-Castro counterrevolutionary forces, Mendieta was sent to the United States with her sister under Operation Pedro Pan. They spent their first weeks in refugee camps before being sent to an orphanage in Dubuque, Iowa. In 1966, the year she began studying painting at the University of Iowa, Mendieta was reunited with her mother and younger brother; her father joined them in 1979, having spent 18 years in a Cuban political prison for his involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion.</p><p>Mendieta received a BA in art in 1969 and an MA in painting in 1972, both from the University of Iowa. Seeking a more powerful means of image making, Mendieta then enrolled in the university''s progressive MFA Intermedia Program, founded and led by the German artist Hans Breder. She found an affinity with the work of Vito Acconci, Lynda Benglis, Chris Burden, Bruce Nauman, Robert Smithson, and Carolee Schneeman, as well as the work of the Viennese Actionists and the Fluxus group. She quickly developed a prolific practice in which her body, the earth, and other organic materials such as blood, fire, feathers, and wood served as the subject of photographs, slides, films, and videos, as well as performances, prints, and artist''s books. In 1973 Mendieta traveled with her MFA class to Mexico, where she began her <em>Silueta</em> (Silhouette) series (1973&ndash;80), in which her body, or more often, a simple outline of her figure, was impressed into various sites outdoors and the impression documented through photography or film. That same year she performed <em>Untitled (Rape Scene)</em> in her apartment in response to the rape and murder of a local student, and made the video <em>Sweating Blood</em>; in both works she again used her own body to address violence against women.</p><p>In the mid-1970s Mendieta started exhibiting internationally and regularly visiting New York, eventually moving to the city in 1978, a few months after completing her MFA. In 1979 she presented a solo exhibition of her photographs at A.I.R. Gallery in New York, where she met the Minimalist sculptor Carl Andre, whom she would marry in 1985. In 1980 Mendieta was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship and a National Endowment for the Arts grant. She was also invited to exhibit in shows sponsored by the Cuban government, and this initiated a period of reconnection with her homeland. In 1983 she spent a year in Italy as the recipient of the Rome Prize, during which she realized studio-based sculpture for the first time. From 1983 until her death in September 1985, Mendieta lived between Rome and New York.</p>\r\n<p>The New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York hosted Mendieta''s first survey exhibition in 1987, and in 2004 the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., organized a major traveling retrospective. In 2009 Mendieta was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Cintas Foundation.</p>','2011-04-21',10686,NULL,'2012-12-18 21:19:37');
